We are building open-source tools to improve data management for computational biology.

Our website just launched at `lamin.dev`, a place for sharing prototypes with our beta customers and collaborators. Over time, we'll add public releases and use this blog to explain our work.

We're currently without funding but hope to start a company that will monetize a paid tier of features on top of core open-source tools.

A proper introduction will follow! :sweat_smile:
