# Hello world!

We're building new tools to improve data management for computational biology. Most of these tools are going to be open source.

Our website just launched atÂ [lamin.ai](https://lamin.ai). It's currently a place for sharing prototypes with our beta customers and collaborators. Over time, we'll add public releases and use this blog to explain our work.

<h5>Notes<a class="headerlink" href="#notes">#</a></h5>

- Why Lamin? We thought about a metaphor for *an interfacing layer between biology and computing*, wrote down a list of 43 words, and liked Lamin the most. Lamin proteins make up the essential filament layer that provides the cell nucleus with structural and functional support.
- The logo is inspired by fluorescent images of a human cell nucleus with stained lamin proteins (Figure 1).
