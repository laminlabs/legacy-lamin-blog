At Lamin Labs, we build new tools to improve data & analysis management for computational biology.
Most of these tools are going to be open source.

Why Lamin? We thought about a metaphor for _an interfacing layer between biology and computing_, wrote down a list of 43 words, and liked Lamin the most.
[Lamin proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamin) make up the essential filament layer that provides the cell nucleus with structural and functional support.
Sunny made the logo thinking of fluorescent images of human cell nuclei with stained lamin proteins (**Figure 1**).

We just launched [lamin.ai](https://lamin.ai).[^ai]
It's currently a place for sharing prototypes with our beta customers and collaborators.
Over time, we'll add public releases and use this blog to explain our work.

[^ai]: Yes, we've been aware of hype around "AI" for years.
    When we say "AI", we mean the [same thing as Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence): artificial as opposed to natural intelligence, a wide field containing statistical machine learning, knowledge representation and more.
    Lamin Labs aims to enable more AI for biology.
