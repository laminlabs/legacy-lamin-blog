We just launched [lamin.ai](https://lamin.ai) as a place for sharing prototypes with our beta customers and collaborators.
Over time, we'll add public releases and use this blog to explain our work.

Why Lamin? It's a metaphor for an interfacing layer between biology and computing.
[Lamin proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamin) make up the essential filament layer that provides the cell nucleus with structural and functional support.[^ai]

[^ai]: Why ".ai"? There has been hype and confusion around "AI" for years.
    When we say "AI", we mean the [same thing as Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence): artificial as opposed to natural intelligence, a wide field containing data science, machine learning, knowledge representation and more.
    Lamin Labs aims to enable more AI for biology.
